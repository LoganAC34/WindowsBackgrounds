# WindowsBackgrounds
Changes each monitors background to a different image while taking in account monitor orientation and position

1. To use, download latest stable release exe and place it in the folder you want to contain all your background images.
2. Run the exe to initialize settup.
3. One it finishes running, place any images you want your background to cycle through into the "Backgrounds" folder.

By default, it adds any new backgrounds to the end of the cycle in alphabetical order. If you want to randomize the order a bit, you can run the "ShuffleOrder.exe". Otherwise, it will just use each background one after the other, and then restart the same order once all images are used.
