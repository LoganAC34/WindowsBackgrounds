# WindowsBackgrounds
Changes each monitors background to a different image while taking in account monitor orientation and position. You can also use this in combination with windows task scheduler to change your background at a specific time or event. 

1. To use, download the latest stable release exe and place it in the folder you want to contain all your background images.
2. Run the exe to initialize setup.
3. Once it finishes running, place any images you want your background to cycle through into the "Backgrounds" folder.

By default, it adds any new backgrounds to the end of the cycle in alphabetical order. If you want to randomize the order a bit, you can run the "ShuffleOrder.exe". Otherwise, it will just use each background one after the other, and then restart the same order once all images are used.

Optional:

After initialization, you can edit the generated "Settings.cfg" and change the "UseWindowsBackgrounds" value to "True" if you want it to use microsoft created images as seen on the lock screen.
